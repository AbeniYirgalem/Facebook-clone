# Facebook Clone App

A Flutter + Firebase demo that mimics the core Facebook surfaces: splash, authentication, a home feed with stories and composer, and a lightweight settings screen.

## Features

- **Firebase auth**: Email/password sign-in, Google sign-in, and sign-up flows with validation and error messaging.
- **Splash → Auth routing**: Branded splash that auto-navigates to the login screen.
- **Login & Sign-up UIs**: Accessible form fields, loading states, and navigation between login and account creation.
- **Home feed**: Stories row, quick actions, post composer that adds new posts to the in-memory feed, and sample posts with images.
- **Settings**: Sign-out (including Google session cleanup) with confirmation and progress feedback.
- **Styling**: Facebook-inspired blue theme, modern Material layout, works across mobile form factors.

## Tech Stack

- Flutter (Material)
- Firebase Core & Firebase Auth (Email/Password, Google)

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (stable channel) installed and on PATH
- Firebase project with Auth enabled (Email/Password and Google providers)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter tooling

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd facebook_app
flutter pub get
```

2. Configure Firebase

- Ensure `lib/firebase_options.dart` matches your Firebase project (regenerate with `flutterfire configure` if needed).
- Add platform configs generated by FlutterFire:
  - Android: `android/app/google-services.json`
  - iOS: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- Enable the Auth providers you use (Email/Password, Google) in the Firebase Console.

3. Run

```bash
flutter run
```

## Notes

- The feed data is local/in-memory for demo purposes; integrate your backend or Firestore to persist posts.
- Update assets and branding as needed under `assets/`.
